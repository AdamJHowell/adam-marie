		<h2>Marie's baby bump!</h2>

		Marie at week 18:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week18.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 18 bump picture"><br>
		Adam remembers this as the first time that she actually looked pregnant.

		Marie at week 19:<br>

			This was taken in a discarded smelting pot from Geneva Steel. &nbsp;The pot was being used as a landmark on the corner of Orem Center Street and Geneva Road. &nbsp;Adam wanted his picture taken in the pot, and talked his wife into posing for a bump picture in the same location.

		<br>
		Marie at week 20:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week20.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 20 bump picture"><br>
		Not much change from week 19.
		<br>

		<br>
		Marie at week 21:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week21.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 21 bump picture"><br>
		Okay, that's starting to look like a pregnancy bump.
		<br>

		<br>
		Marie at week 22:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week22.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 22 bump picture"><br>
		Not much of a change since last week.
		<br>

		<br>
		Marie at week 23:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week23.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 23 bump picture"><br>
		Okay, that's getting big.
		<br>

		<br>
		Marie at week 24:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week24.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 24 bump picture"><br>
		How cute is she?!
		<br>

		<br>
		Marie at week 25:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week25.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 25 bump picture"><br>
		Glowing!

		<img src="images/bump/Week26.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 26 bump picture"><br>
		This is when Adam got suspicious that Marie was faking it. &nbsp;I mean, look at that belly! &nbsp;She surely is wearing a prosthetic!
		<br>

		<br>
		Marie at week 27:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week27.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:667px" alt="Marie's week 27 bump picture"><br>
		What an adorable little pregnant lady.
		<br>

		<br>
		We missed one week of pictures, and cannot find one other week. &nbsp;So we skip from week 27 to week 30.&nbsp;Sorry.<br>
		This is when pregnancy started getting really tough.<br>

		<br>
		Marie at week 30:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week30_01.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:583px" alt="Marie's week 30 bump picture"><br>

		Marie at week 31:<br>
		<img src="images/bump/Week31_04.jpg" style="border-width:0px;width:500px;height:612px" alt="Marie's week 31 bump picture"><br>
		Getting larger every week.
