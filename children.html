		Alexis Karren was born 2016-08-05 at 18:36 MDT. &nbsp;She weighed 5 pounds 1 ounce, and was 16.0 inches long.<br>
		Katherine Judith was born 2016-08-05 at 18:47 MDT. &nbsp;She weighed 5 pounds 2 ounces, and was 16.1 inches long.<br>
		<br>
		Katherine had a slightly low blood sugar level when she was born, but rebounded quickly and met all of her numbers by the next day.<br>
		Alexis met all of her numbers at first, but struggled to keep her blood sugar level up. &nbsp;This meant she was fed a few milliliters of glucose from time to time. &nbsp;It made her smell like a bakery, or cotton candy. &nbsp;As if we needed a reason to love her more.<br>

		Mommy's temperature spiked to 38 degrees Celsius during labor (37.0 degrees Celsius is normal body temperature). &nbsp;The doctor wanted antibiotics run on mother and child. &nbsp;Alexis went to the nursery first. &nbsp;Daddy followed her, while Katherine stayed with mommy and the four grandparents. &nbsp;This meant dad got to pick out the bow to put in her hair. &nbsp;Gold was chosen, because it was unique, and there was only one left. &nbsp;When Katherine arrived in the nursery, dad chose silver for her. &nbsp;Later it was realized that they were born on the opening day of the 2016 Olympics in Rio. &nbsp;Alexis took gold, and Katherine took silver.<br>
		<br>
		Cousin Ashton later told us that it was also the first day of National Twin Day 2016 (National Twin Day is the first full weekend in August, Friday to Sunday).<br>

		For their first checkup, both girls had gained weight! &nbsp;Alexis had gained a half ounce, and Katherine had gained 2.5 ounces. &nbsp;They also each gained more than an inch in length. &nbsp;I suspect that the delivery room length measurements may have been less than accurate.<br>
		Alexis had slightly elevated bilirubin levels, and had to be checked daily via a blood draw from her heel. &nbsp;She slept through all four draws.<br>
		Katherine had a slight heart murmur, and had to have an echo cardiogram. &nbsp;That revealed a small problem with her pulmonary valve. &nbsp;This is nothing major, but needs to be rechecked in three months.<br>

		Shortly after their first (sponge) bath at home. &nbsp;I like this picture because it looks like Katherine is upset and Alexis is happy (maybe even air-guitaring). &nbsp;I took another picture two seconds later and Katherine was mellow.<br>

		Soon, the worst part of the rivalry came to surface, and a fight broke out! &nbsp;James says that this was "targeting". &nbsp;But Katherine is not going down without a fight, and throws the first punch! &nbsp;Both were ejected from the game.<br>
		Actually, Oakley just wanted to kiss her cousins. &nbsp;But we all agreed this capture looks more like a fight.<br>

		Kate is doing this accidentally. &nbsp;We tried reacting to it, in an effort to encourage it further, but that did not seem to work.<br>
		She only made the bear noise for a week or two. &nbsp;I wish that I had captured a better example of this, but she stopped making the noise earlier than I expected.<br>

		This is how we took them around in their stroller. &nbsp;Cousin Sherrie gave us the pink bear suits, and they work great for keeping little girls warm in their stroller.<br>
		You would not believe how many people commented on how cute the girls looked. &nbsp;Those people were correct.<br>
